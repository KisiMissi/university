### Exercise 1: 
Using parameters in methods that return values In this exercise, you create a Utils class in which you define a Greater method. This method will take two integer parameters and return the larger of the parameters. To test how this class works, you will use the Program class, which will ask the user for two numbers, then call the Utils.Greater method, and then display the result on the console screen.

### Exercise 2: 
Using parameters passed by reference in methods In this exercise you will create a Swap method that swaps parameter values. You will use parameters passed by reference to swap.

### Exercise 3:
Using Returned Parameters in Methods In this exercise you will create a Factorial method that takes an integer variable and calculates its factorial using an iterative algorithm.

### Exercise 4: 
Calculate the area of a triangle using a method Require you to create an Operation class in which you define:  a static method for calculating the area of a triangle using the Heron formula (see Exercise 1 of Lab 2). This method must take three parameters (sides of the triangle) and return the value of the area;  static closed method for checking if the triangle exists. This method should return a value of a boolean type;  an overloaded static method that will take one parameter, a side, and calculate the area of an equilateral triangle. 

### Exercise 5:
Calculating Roots of a Quadratic Equation We need to implement a method to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation.  function must return the value of 1 if the roots are found, the value of zero if both roots are the same, and the value -1 if there are no roots.  the values of the roots of the equations should be returned as arguments to the function passed by reference.
